						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p> I am originally from Austin, Texas. I have also lived in Chapel Hill, NC, and currently live in Philadelphia, PA. I work as a research project manager at the <a href="http://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/"> Metadata Research Center</a>, located at Drexel University. In my spare time, I like to brew beer, bike around the city, cook, play board games, read, garden (I volunteer at a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lafinquitasouthkensington"> community garden</a>), and make things (see my knitting projects on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/people/grumbledore"> Ravelry</a>).
